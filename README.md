# Breast_Cancer_SVM_Task7
This is Task 7 of my AI/ML Internship. I implemented Support Vector Machines using linear and RBF kernels on a binary classification dataset.

##  Task Objective:
- Train an SVM classifier (linear & RBF kernels)
- Tune hyperparameters C and gamma
- Visualize decision boundaries
- Evaluate with cross-validation and confusion matrix

##  Dataset:
- Source: [Breast Cancer Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/breast-cancer-dataset)
- File: `data.csv`

##  Tools Used:
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Outputs:
- Accuracy, precision, recall
- Confusion matrix heatmap
- Decision boundary visualization
- Cross-validation scores
